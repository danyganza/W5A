                <p>The following is a list of songs by P-Square organized by alphabetical order. The songs on the list
                    are all included in official label-released albums, soundtracks and singles, but not white label or
                    other non-label releases. Next to the song titles is the album, soundtrack, or single on which it
                    appears. Remixes and live versions of songs are listed as bullet points below the original song, but
                    clean, explicit, a cappella and instrumental tracks are not included.

                    The version that most of us are familiar with is the French omelette - slightly browned on the
                    outside, creamy on the inside and filled with anything from simple herbs to meat or vegetables.</p>
